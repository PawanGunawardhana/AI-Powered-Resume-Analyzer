AI - Powered Resume Analyzer is a tool that uses artificial intelligence to analyze resumes and provide insights on how well they match the requirements of a job posting. It can help recruiters and hiring managers to quickly and accurately identify the most qualified candidates for a position.
Here are some of the key features of AI - Powered Resume Analyzer:

1. Resume Parsing: The tool can parse resumes and extract relevant information such as work experience, education

### Step 3: Implement the Resume Parser

To implement the resume parser, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning algorithms. We will use the following steps:

1. Preprocessing: We will preprocess the resume text by removing stop words, stemming words, and
   lemmatizing words.
2. Tokenization: We will split the resume text into individual words or tokens.
3. Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: We will identify the part of speech
